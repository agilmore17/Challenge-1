# Challenge-1
First Challenge Assignment for UofR Data Bootcamp


For this assignment, all formulas / transformations come from prior excel knowledge, or what was taught in class with the exception of the section on converting timestamps (which was provided to us).

We were tasked with transforming a dataset of Crowdfunding information into a more digestible format. 

To do so, I used conditional formatting to make the failures / successes easier to see and assigned color values to exemplify how well funded the projects were.

After this, I created 3 Pivot tables that broke down the Parent and Sub categories to show a visual of how successful Crowdfunded projects were in those spaces & how successful they are based on the time of year. 

Then, I did an analysis using a =COUNTIFS statement to create a small table that shows what percentages of crowdfunding was successful based on the goal amount for the project. 

Lastly, I found the Mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the dataset to determine how variable the data is and what best summarizes the data.
